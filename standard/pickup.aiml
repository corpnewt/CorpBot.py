<li>Do you want to hear a joke?</li>
<li>Are we still talking about <srai>POP</srai> ?</li>
<li>We were talking about <srai>POP</srai>. But I did not get that.</li>
<li>I've lost the context, <get name="name"/>.  Are we still on <srai>POP</srai>?</li>
<li>That remark was too complicated for me. We were talking about <srai>POP</srai>. </li>
<li>I can follow a lot of things, like our discussion about <srai>POP</srai>. Try being more specific. </li>
<li>Why, specifically?</li>
<li>Are you free?</li>
<li>That is deep.</li>
<li>Tell me a story.</li>
<li>How old are you?</li>
<li>Are you a student?</li>
<li>Oh, you are a poet.</li>
<li>I do not understand.</li>
<li>Where are you located?</li>
<li>What time is it there?</li>
<li>What do you look like?</li>
<li>Ask me another question.</li>
<li>I like the way you talk.</li>
<li>Is that your final answer?</li>
<li>Do you like talking to me?</li>
<li>Do you prefer books or TV?</li>
<li>Who are you talking about?</li>
<li>Let us change the subject.</li>
<li>I've been waiting for you.</li>
<li>Can you tell me any gossip?</li>
<li>I lost my train of thought.</li>
<li>Can we get back to business?</li>
<li>Have you ever been to Europe?</li>
<li>What kind of food do you like?</li>
<li>How did you hear about <bot name="name"/>?</li>
<li>That is a very original thought.</li>
<li>What were we talking about again?</li>
<li>What do you do in your spare time?</li>
<li>What do you really want to ask me?</li>
<li>Does "it" still refer to <get name="it"/>?</li>
<li>Can you speak any foreign languages?</li>
<li>We have never talked about it before.</li>
<li>How do you usually introduce yourself?</li>
<li>Tell me about your likes and dislikes?</li>
<li>Are we still talking about <get name="it"/>?</li>
<li>Try putting that in a more specific context.</li>
<li>Who is your favorite Science Fiction author?</li>
<li>Not many people express themselves that way.</li>
<li>Do you have any idea what I am talking about?</li>
<li>I will mention that to my <bot name="botmaster"/>, <get name="name"/>.</li>
<li>Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.</li>
<li>Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.</li>
<li>If you could have any kind of robot what would it be?</li>
<li>My brain does not have a response for that.</li>
<li>By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?</li>
<li>What you said was too complicated for me.</li>
<li>You may be wondering if this is a person or a computer responding.</li>
<li>When do you think artificial intelligence will replace lawyers?</li>
<li>Can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas, or different thoughts?</li>
