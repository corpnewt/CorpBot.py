# CorpBot.py
A *slightly* less clumsy python bot for discord

***

# Basic Settings

The bot's basic settings should be in a file called `settings_dict.json` in the same folder as the `Main.py` file.  Some basic formatting of this file would look like so:

```json
{
    "prefix": "your_custom_prefix_here",
    "token": "your_token_here",
    "weather": "your_weather_api_key_here",
    "currency": "your_currency_api_key_here"
}
```

You'll want to replace the values with your own.  The `prefix` key can be omitted, and the bot will fallback on its default `$` prefix.

# WARNING

This branch of CorpBot requires a Redis database server running to function correctly.  For Windows users, you can download the release [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases) and just run the `redis-server.exe` with the default settings after unzipping the archive for the bot to connect to the db.

# !Breaking Changes!

As of [this commit](https://github.com/corpnewt/CorpBot.py/commit/c094ca55a2f368d36d4385aaf6d8a8f6ff13f588), the database backend has changed.  I uploaded a [convenience script](https://gist.github.com/corpnewt/131548261eb4981e8f4a666d628e861d) that can dump the old redis db format to a Settings.json file which can be placed in CorpBot's folder so that it will be migrated to the new db format on restart.
