# CorpBot.py
A *slightly* less clumsy python bot for discord

***

# Basic Settings

The bot's basic settings should be in a file called `settings_dict.json` in the same folder as the `Main.py` file.  Some basic formatting of this file would look like so:

```json
{
    "prefix": "your_custom_prefix_here",
    "token": "your_token_here",
    "weather": "your_weather_api_key_here",
    "currency": "your_currency_api_key_here"
}
```

You'll want to replace the values with your own.  The `prefix` key can be omitted, and the bot will fallback on its default `$` prefix.
