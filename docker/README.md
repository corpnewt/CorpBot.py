# Docker support for CorpBot.py

This is a short document detailing the current status of the Docker images, including how to set them up.

## Features

#### Implemented

- [x] Bot running smoothly inside Docker (tested and works well)
- [x] Full data persistence (data is stored under `/data`, see `docker-compose.yml`)
- [x] Lavalink support both as a Docker container and an external service (playback tested and works well)
- [x] Docker image for Linux (tested and working)
- [x] Docker image for Windows (largely untested)

#### Planned

- [ ] Fix/update CI workflow to use new GH registry URL
- [ ] Fix/update CI workflow to support Windows (if/when available)
- [ ] ARM image support (CorpBot itself runs fine on ARM)
- [ ] Redis support (redis branch)
- [ ] MongoDB support (same deal)
- [ ] Optimized, minimal image sizes (Alpine, multi-staged builds, Windows image needs special attention)
