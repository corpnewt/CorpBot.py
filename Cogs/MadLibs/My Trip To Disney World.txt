Last month, I went to Disney World with [[friend's name]]. We traveled for [[number]] hours by [[noun]]. Finally, we arrived and it was very [[adjective]]. There were [[adjective]] people [[-ing verb]] everywhere. There were also people dressed up in [[noun]] costumes.   I wish it had been more [[adjective]], but we [[past tense verb]] anyway. We also went on a(n) [[adjective]] ride called Magic [[Noun]]. [[Friends name]] nearly fell off a ride and had to be [[past tense verb]]. Later, we went to the hotel and [[past tense verb]]. Next year, I want to go to [[place]], where we can [[verb]].
