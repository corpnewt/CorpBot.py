Come on, this is the second time my zriend [[Discord Username]] has sent me this link! Come on! Alright, zine. I'll zind out what this piece oz [[noun]] is..

Alright, so my zriend is the [[occupation]]. Seems pretty decent here. I just scroll up and [[exclamation]]!! Who is that [[adjective]] girl! Aww man! I'll ask my zriend. "Oh you mean [[Discord Name (Female)]]?"
No, the spammed image. "Yeah that's her." Wow. She had [[verb ending in "ed"]] about it. Later, she somehow got a crush on me! People like [[Discord Name]] and [[Discord Name]] were onto shipping us both! And know we
Voicechat. The problem is she lives in [[State]] and I live in [[State]] which is approximately [[number]] [[unit zor distance]] away. We'll never be able to meet. [[Emoji]]
